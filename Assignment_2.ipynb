    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans: Two values of the boolean operator are TRUE, FALSE. It is usd in conjunction with logical operator AND,OR,NOT. \n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans: AND,OR,NOT\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans: True + True - True\n",
    "     True + False- False\n",
    "     False + True - False\n",
    "     False + False - False\n",
    "4. What are the values of the following expressions?\n",
    "(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) ----> False\n",
    "not (5 > 4) ---> False\n",
    "(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ---> True\n",
    "not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ---> False\n",
    "(True and True) and (True == False) ---> False\n",
    "(not False) or (not True)---> True\n",
    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "Ans: >\n",
    "<\n",
    "!=\n",
    ">=\n",
    "<=\n",
    "==\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans: assignment operator is used to assign/store some value in a variable. Like a=12 here a will store 12 in it's cache memory. While equal to operator is usdd for comaprison and it will give True/False as output like 12==13\n",
    "7. Identify the three blocks in this code:\n",
    "spam = 0\n",
    "if spam == 10:\n",
    "print('eggs')---- First block\n",
    "if spam > 5:\n",
    "print('bacon') ------second block\n",
    "else:\n",
    "print('ham')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "print('spam')------ Third block\n",
    "8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.\n",
    "spam=int(input())\n",
    "if (spam ==1):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "elif (spam==2):\n",
    "    print(\"Howdy\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Greetings!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?\n",
    "Ans: In kernel, we can press restart.\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Ans: Break will come out of loop and move on to next statements where as in continue it will in loop for next values.\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Ans: range(10) --0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n",
    "range(0,10) -- means it will start with 0 and move till 10 so in this case we will have same result i.e 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and range(0,10,1) means it will start from 0 till 10 wuh step size of 1.\n",
    "12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "FOR LOOP:\n",
    "for i in range(1,11,1):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "WHILE LOOP:\n",
    "i=1\n",
    "while i <=10:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i+=1;\n",
    "13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans: spam.bacon()"
